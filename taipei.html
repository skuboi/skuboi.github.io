              Bruin AdTeam built a comprehensive advertising campaign for 2017's American Advertising Federation's National Student Advertising Competition. The client was Ajinomoto Windsor's <span class="bolded"> Asian frozen entree brand, Tai Pei. </span> They tasked us with building brand relevance, increasing product sales, and combatting the stigma surrounding frozen food.
              <br><br>
              Our research suggested Tai Pei provides the <span class="bolded"> familiar flavor of Chinese food, without the costs. </span> Therefore, we focused our campaign on emphasizing the savings of <span class="bolded">time, money, and effort </span> to appeal to busy, budget-minded Millennials who find it difficult to cook at home.
              <br><br>
              Whether they are college students or new to the workforce, millennials are all about the hustle, reflected in our tagline -- <span class="bolded"> Hustle Shouldn't Leave You Hungry. </span>
              <br><br>
              We then appealed to millennials by creating an <span class="bolded"> authentic, humorous, and ambitious spokesperson -- DJ PeiDay. </span> Our creative executions centered around this character that personified the hustle and need for convenient, satisfying meal options.
              <br><br>
              I led the Strategic Plannning subteam to develop the foundation for this campaign to substantiate Creative's ideas and advertisements, complemented by Media Planning's optimized channels and placements.
              <br><br>
              We are proud of our unique, resonant, and fun campaign. Our plansbook is below:

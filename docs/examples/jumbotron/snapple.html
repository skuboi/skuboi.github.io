              Bruin AdTeam built a dual-strategy campaign for 2016's American Advertising Federation's National Student Advertising Competition. The client was <span class="bolded"> Snapple. </span> They tasked us with developing a united campaign that targeted customers in the "Heartland" (New York) and "Non-Heartland," to <span class="bolded"> stregthen brand loyalty and increase purchase frequency. </span>
              <br><br>
              After thorough research and brainstorming, Strategic Planning presented a single-minded proposition as the guiding principle to the creative executions -- <span class="bolded"> Made For You. Made From Tradition. Made For The Future. Made From The Best Stuff On Earth." </span>
              <br><br>
              We developed three consumer profiles that mapped onto the three characteristics. "Made For You" appealed to those who focus on the tangible features of Snapple products, rather than brand sentiment. "Made From Tradition" to appeal to Heartland Brand Buyers' sense of nostalgia and sentimentality. "Made For The Future" positions Snapple as a pro-social, forward-thinking brand to build affinity in the Non-Heartland.
              <br><br>
              With our tagline, <span class="bolded"> Snap into the Moment, </span> we made creative executions tailored to these customer segments.
